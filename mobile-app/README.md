artifacts with sensitive information like API keys. To avoid this, developers will
need to configure their own Firebase project.

2. Log into Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```
3. Install FlutterFire CLI
```bash
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
```
4. Configure App to use Firebase, and choose the GopherEye project
```bash
flutterfire configure
```

### Google Maps API Key
Add the following file to you project

ios/Runner/Base.lproj/google_maps_api_key.txt
```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
```
